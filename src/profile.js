    "I am a Junior software developer, I began my developer journey in 2022 with Developers Institute. During my first year at the Developers Institute, I learned the fundamentals, like version control, effective communication, and how to build web apps using PERN and MERN stacks. In my second year, I moved onto studying topics like application security, and mobile development. Developers Institute went out of business before I graduated, so I finished the remainder of my studies at Yoobee College. This brings us to today, I have now completed my studies and have a level 5 and 6 diploma in software development, and am eager to land my first position as a web developer. ",
